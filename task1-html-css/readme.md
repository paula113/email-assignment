# First Task - HTML Email Template

Task Description: The goal of this task is to create an email template using HTML and inline CSS that closely matches the design in Design_A.png. The email should be optimized for cross-platform compatibility across different email clients.

- Send a test email using PutsMail to check rendering in email clients.

## Guidelines

- [x] Use only inline CSS for styling.
