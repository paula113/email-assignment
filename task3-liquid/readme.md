# Task Three - Liquid Email Template  

## Task Description  
The goal of this task is to **rewrite the product card section** of an email template using **Liquid** instead of **Velocity**. The product card should be treated as a **reusable component**, making it easier to use in different templates.  

## Requirements  
- Convert the **product card logic** from Velocity to Liquid.  
- Maintain **HTML and inline CSS** best practices for email compatibility.  
- Ensure the product card is a **reusable component**.  
- Save the file as **`.html`**, even though it contains Liquid syntax.  

## How to Use  
-  Open the file in a browser to preview its structure.
- Send a test email using PutsMail to check rendering in email clients.


## Guidelines 
- [x] Use only inline CSS for styling.
- [x] Avoid external stylesheets as they are not fully supported in email clients.
- [x] Ensure the layout is responsive and displays correctly on both desktop and mobile.
- [x] Test in different email clients to confirm compatibility.
